# Task-CLI (C++) 

## Overview

**Task-CLI** is a simple command-line application to track and manage your tasks. It allows you to create tasks with descriptions, view all tasks, update or delete tasks, mark tasks as **todo**, **in-progress**, or **done**, and store tasks persistently in a JSON file. This project is written in C++17 and provides a lightweight, easy-to-use interface for task management from the terminal.
It is also a ðŸ‡«ðŸ‡· student project for exploring C++, so it is written in C++. It surely contains multiple issues, some code even generated by GPT because I was really tired. If you notice any problems or areas that could be improved, I would greatly appreciate your feedback, as it will help me learn and improve my skills.

## Features

* Add, update, and delete tasks
* Mark tasks as **todo**, **in-progress**, or **done**
* List tasks by status or list all tasks
* Get total number of tasks created
* Persistent storage in JSON format
* Lightweight, dependency-free, pure C++17

## Requirements

* Linux OS (or compatible environment)
* g++ compiler supporting C++17
* Make

## Installation / Building from Source

Option 1 â€” Download a precompiled binary
- Releases page: https://github.com/duwuzil/TASKCLI-PROJECT/releases
- Download the latest release binary (example): https://github.com/duwuzil/TASKCLI-PROJECT/releases/download/v0.0.1/task-cli

Option 2 â€” build it with cmake
1. Clone the repository:

```bash
git clone <repository-url>
cd Task-CLI
```

2. Go to the Build directory:

```bash
cd Build
```

3. Compile the project using Make:

```bash
make
```

4. Run the CLI:

```bash
./task-cli help
```

> This will display all available commands and usage instructions.

## Usage

**Add a Task:**

```bash
task-cli add "Buy groceries"
# Output: Task added successfully (ID: 1)
```

**Update a Task:**

```bash
task-cli update 1 "Buy groceries and cook dinner"
# Task with ID 1 is updated
```

**Delete a Task:**

```bash
task-cli delete 1
# Task with ID 1 is removed
```

**Mark Task Status:**

```bash
task-cli mark todo 2
task-cli mark in-progress 3
task-cli mark done 4
```

**List Tasks:**

```bash
task-cli list
task-cli list todo
task-cli list in-progress
task-cli list done
```

## JSON Storage Format

Tasks are stored in `Source/data/tasks.json` in the following format:

```json
[
  {
    "id": 1,
    "description": "Buy groceries",
    "status": "todo",
    "createdAt": "2025-10-22 21:00:00",
    "updatedAt": "2025-10-22 21:00:00"
  },
  {
    "id": 2,
    "description": "Finish homework",
    "status": "in-progress",
    "createdAt": "2025-10-22 21:05:00",
    "updatedAt": "2025-10-22 21:10:00"
  }
]
```

* `id` â†’ unique identifier
* `description` â†’ task text
* `status` â†’ `todo`, `in-progress`, or `done`
* `createdAt` â†’ creation timestamp
* `updatedAt` â†’ last update timestamp
